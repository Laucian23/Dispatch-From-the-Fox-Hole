It is a history that is not often regarded, and as often as it is forgot, it is just as often misremembered. It isn't impossible to see why students lack any identification or connection with their current student representation groups. It is simply a consequence of a years of policy that continually alienates and deprioritizes student led projects and voices.</p><p>It bears mentioning, however, that this was not always the case. For a period of time few people are aware of, the student body did have a consistent and valid means of representation. A group of passionate, dedicated students who sought after the highest journalistic standards. This group organized themselves under the name, 'The Carousel'. They were in regular operation from the times of 1956-1978. Little is known about their work, as few archival copies have stood the test of time. Even today, our editorial team has conducted research and uncovered little evidence of their activities beyond their very existence. And exist they still did. </p><p>Proof of this came, when in 1978 the group formally changed their name to 'The Fox Tales' and ramped up production and scale. What was once a few students blossomed into a well oiled machine. Remnants of this period still exist to this day, as the faculty newsletter (of which few students are aware of, and of which no students can participate,) has adopted and used their moniker.</p><p>All good things come to an end, and for reasons unknown (or undisclosed) the group ceased production in 1994. Little can be extrapolated beyond conjecture. Is it possible they simply fizzled out from lack of member ship? Perhaps. Is it also possible that the student voice was once more left to the wayside. No one can say.</p><p>All that said, and our mission becomes clear. At a time when enrollment is at an all time high, changes and stratagem in the faculty are constantly evolving, and when students feel more so than ever unseen and unheard; we must come forth. Think of those who will come after us, those who will graduate in years to come. If they, when only freshmen, are unaware of the policies and information that is not readily available to the them, certainly no one can contrast the new with the old. Gauge interest. Garner feedback.</p><p>This is why we are here, and why we stand. With an editorial body numbering in the double digits, interest and reception in the student body at upwards fifty prospective members, we present ourselves as the new reliable source of all news concerning student life. We will continue in this endeavor in face of opposition, ensuring we remain unbiased and factual in everything we present. That, is why <strong>we</strong> write. </p><p>For <strong>you</strong>,</p><p>For <strong>all of us</strong>.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>We are non-affiliated with any organization or group.
